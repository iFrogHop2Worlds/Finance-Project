# Finance-Project
A banking environment written in c++

The aim of this project is to refresh/sharpen my c++ skills and create a generalised codebase that can reused to speedup development in future projects.

The system we are building will facilitate a full baking environment but will be general and modular so you could theoretically use peices of it to construct many things.

Maybe used as a base for trading, account software or even an account/currency system for a game.
